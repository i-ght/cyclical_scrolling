O Mind! do love Her
Who can take thee across the sea of birth and death.
Make a firm resolve; the net-work of relations is worthless.
Hopes from wealth and relatives are unavailing. Hast thou forgotten thy past history?
Where wast thou? Where hast thou come? Whither wilt thou go?
In this world thou assumest a disguise and dancest impelled by a mysterious power.
Thou art on the lap of cosmic nescience, and confined in a prison.
To egoism, hate, love, and attachment to favourable objects--
For what reason hast thou given the kingdom of thy body?
There is no remedy for this! The day is nearly at an end.
Meditate on Durga always in the abode of Siva in the island of gems.
Prasada says, "The name of Durga is full of nectar and the abode of beatitude.
Mutter it incessantly and drench thy tongue in nectar."
